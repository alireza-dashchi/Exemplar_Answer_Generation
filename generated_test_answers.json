This is because the ovules need to be fertilised by the pollen before they can develop into seeds. If the ovules were located elsewhere, such as in the anther, this would not be possible","actual_answer":"The ova (eggs) or ovules are protected from damage and from predators by being located in the ovary"}

{"question_id":"29d66243-caf5-4852-ab9c-1a275d47909e","generated_answer":"The Acropolis is a remarkable testament to ancient Greek civilization. It is a symbol of democracy, philosophy, and the arts, and is often viewed as the cradle of western civilization. The Parthenon was built to honour the goddess Athena, who was the patron of Athens. The Acropolis is also a UNESCO World Heritage site and is recognised as one of the wonders of the modern world","actual_answer":"The Acropolis is one of the most famous ancient sites in the world. It is a monument to the impact that ancient Greek art, government, and culture have had on the world throughout history. This legacy has made it central to Greek identity. It offers us a direct link to the past and also acts as a major site for tourism. More than 7 million people visit the Acropolis each year, so it has an important economic value today"}
{"question_id":"4a88c793-81f6-40d0-ba70-c67159e1d8e0","generated_answer":"Machiavelli would have suggested that they resolve this situation through force. He would have believed that a show of strength would help to discourage such behaviour in the future. Machiavelli believed that it was better to be feared than loved - so he would have thought that they should make an example of the city-state that attacked them","actual_answer":"The city council had first tried to pacify the factions and broker a peace deal, which was ineffective. This was when they requested help from Florence, who sent in Machiavelli to sort things out.The Pistoian's next strategy was to expel the Panciatichi faction from city because they were hostile to Florentine rule. However, Machiavelli counselled them against this. He said that it would be \u2018highly dangerous\u2019 to keep the Cancellieri within the town and Panciatichi outside it. He feared that this course of action might 'lose all the city or all its territory, and perhaps both together, the one being full of malcontents, the other full of suspicion.'He recommended that the leaders of both factions - even the Cancellieri, who were pro-Florence - be expelled from the city. He also recommended that members of both factions have their arms confiscated and be kept under surveillance to ensure they did not stir up more trouble. He correctly believed that removing the heads of both factions would effectively neuter their threat but ensure that the city did not descend into distrust and suspicion."}

Therefore, as the car starts moving, all gravitational potential energy transforms into kinetic energy, so the answer to this question should be the same as the answer to the question above. However, in reality all the potential energy at the top of the incline does not transform into kinetic energy due to some heat energy lost due to friction"}

{"question_id":"3cc610d2-8039-42df-b630-d4b307e8c6ea","generated_answer":"In rural areas, there are far fewer hospitals and healthcare facilities than in urban areas. The facilities that do exist are often poorly resourced and do not have the same level of care as urban hospitals. There is also a shortage of healthcare professionals in rural areas, which means that people often have to travel great distances to receive treatment. This is particularly difficult for poorer families who may not own a car or have the financial means to afford public transport","actual_answer":"The Indian government spending on healthcare ranks one of the lowest in the world. The rich are barely taxed. Many ordinary Indians are not able to access the health care they need. 63 million of them are pushed into poverty because of healthcare costs every year - almost two people every second"}

{"question_id":"5d329eb6-f916-411d-bdda-2632902f4c49","generated_answer":"Each of the components had a different density. The silt and fine sand were less dense than water, so they floated on top of it. The coarse sand was denser than water, so it sank to the bottom","actual_answer":"The centrifuge works by spinning mixtures, usually liquids, around at high speeds. The force of the spin pushes the heavy, larger, insoluble particles in the liquid or mixture to the bottom while the lighter, smaller, insoluble particles move to the top. By spinning dirty water, heavy insoluble particles such as coarse sand will drop to the bottom while the fine sand will be the next layer, followed by the silt. The clear water should end up on top as it will be the lightest component of the mixture"}
{"question_id":"7c661167-f214-4306-8b04-2f2cf929a704","generated_answer":"A centrifuge spins a mixture to create a centrifugal force. This force pushes denser particles to the outside of the container, where they settle to the bottom. This allows them to be separated from the less dense liquid. This process could be used to clean stormwater by separating pollutants such as silt, oil, or heavy metals from the water.","actual_answer":"Centrifugal force separates out heavy particles from light particles when these particles are too small to be filtered out. Heavy particles\/debris fall to the bottom because of the centrifugal force applied to them and settle there. Lighter particles\/debris settle above them, leaving clean water at the top.If centrifugation was used to clean stormwater, it could remove tiny particles like micro-plastics or sediment which can barely be seen by the naked eye. It would allow the clean water to be separated and released to our waterways whilst the pollutants could be removed"}
{"question_id":"3b7c39e0-8931-4caa-bd9e-23058197e66a","generated_answer":"The Acropolis has faced many threats over the years. In the past, it was attacked and damaged during wars. One of the most damaged periods was in 1687 when the Venetians attacked to try to take Athens back from the Ottomans. The Ottomans had used the Parthenon as a munitions dump, and the Venetians accidentally hit it, causing a large explosion that destroyed much of the building. The Acropolis also suffered from pollution in the 20th century as Athens became more industrialised. However, this was not as big a threat as it used to be, as a lot of the pollution was reduced when Greece joined the EU and stricter regulations were put in place. Current threats include the huge number of tourists that visit the site each year, and the potential for earthquake damage as Greece lies on a fault line. The Acropolis was restored in the 1970s and 80s, and some of the original materials were replaced with modern materials to help prevent further damage. There is also a dedicated police force that watches over the Acropolis to help prevent vandalism and theft","actual_answer":"The Acropolis has been subject to a lot of damage over the years. Some of this has been caused by wars, such as when the Parthenon was hit by a cannonball in 1687. It has also been gradually exposed to weather damage over time, including an earthquake in 1981. In modern times, pollution is a major threat, as is the amount of foot traffic the site gets from tourism.Over time, the Acropolis has been both restored and reconstructed. This has involved things like reassembling broken structures, replacing rusting metal, and continual cleaning."}

This allows it to be separated by using a filter","actual_answer":"The sand and paper particles are different sizes. The sand particles were much smaller than the paper particles. This meant the sand could be separated from the paper using a sieve. The sieve's holes were bigger than the sand particles but smaller than the paper particles, so it could separate the two.The sand could be separated from the water because it is not soluble in water. This means that a filter can separate water and sand. The fact that paper isn't soluble also meant that it could be separated using the sieve"}

Habitat loss is having the biggest impact as bees need a variety of habitats to thrive. If their habitats are destroyed, they can\u2019t survive","actual_answer":"Bee populations are falling because of the heavy use of pesticides used in agriculture. The pesticides kill the bees or impact their ability to reproduce. Loss of habitat due to overgrazing and overpopulation is also a problem because, as more natural areas are destroyed, there are fewer wild plants for bees to feed on. I think the loss of habitat issue is the biggest problem for bees because, if it continues, there will be no habitat left for bees to thrive \u2013 and these natural environments are more important than the farmland where the pesticides are found"}
