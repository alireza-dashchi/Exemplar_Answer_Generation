It stays in inertia, even when a person moves, much like fish within a fishbowl. However, when a strong force acts on a person's skull, the force from this sudden acceleration and\/or deceleration pushes the brain out of inertia and into motion (after a fraction of a second when the head is set in motion by the contact, but the brain remains in inertia).When the brain is set in motion, the brain pushes aside the cerebrospinal fluid (though this acts to slow its movement somewhat). It crashes into the skull wall which, under Newton's first law, can provide the counterforce to stop the brain's motion.

Sport, head trauma, and CTE    Contact sports have always captivated audiences and drawn athletes wanting to demonstrate their speed, strength, and endurance. However, the excitement of huge tackles and body-on-the-line action obscures a more worrying truth. Contact sports can cause serious and irreversible damage to athletes through multiple head knocks or concussions.  In recent decades, we've become more aware of a disease called  Chronic Trauma Encephalophagy (CTE) . CTE is a progressive dying-off of nerve cells in the brain. Right now, we can only definitively diagnose it through a brain autopsy after death. But CTE's early symptoms include confusion, dizziness, and headaches, which turn into memory loss and a lack of emotional control, which culminate in a loss of motor function and a faster onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is no treatment or cure.      What is CTE?      In recent decades, we've learnt that CTE is likely caused by repeated trauma to the head. It's found most often in people who have played combat sports (like boxing and MMA) and contact sports (like Australian rules football, American football, and rugby). It's even been found in soccer players who have spent years heading the ball.      Inside the Brain of a Suspected CTE Patient      CTE can occur from seemingly-harmless head knocks (like heading a soccer ball) if it happens often enough over a long period of time. But it's thought that the most damaging head knocks - and the ones most likely to cause CTE - are those causing concussions.      What Happens When You Have a Concussion?       Explain the impact on the brain from head trauma using Newton's first law  Remember that the brain floats inside your skull, suspended within cerebrospinal fluid   We're only just beginning to learn about the causes and devastating impacts of CTE.  How are researchers attempting to develop and validate new scientific knowledge in this field? How will this help us understand how to prevent, diagnose, or better treat CTE?   In some contact sports (like American football), athletes wear helmets to protect their heads from trauma.  Helmets work by spreading the impact of a head knock over a longer period of time. The hard shell of the helmet and the soft padding inside it absorb some of the impact, meaning that your head's change in motion - caused by the impact - happens less suddenly.

Some solids, liquids, and gases in the world are  mixtures . They are made up of two or more substances that are not chemically combined.

However, this mixture can be separated back into salt and water.

This helps us make sense of a contemporary account whilst also using a later analysis to fill in gaps in our understanding.  In this task, we will look at the democratic process of  ostracising  a citizen from Athens.  Ostracism  was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared.  Let\u2019s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a  secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness).   Source 1 (secondary source)    \u201cThe method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void.

If you have ever tried to run in water, you know that your body slows down and can't move normally. The same thing happens with light when it shines on dense material; it slows down. Not only does it slow down, but the light waves tend to bend in different directions. This bending of light is called  refraction .       How Refraction Occurs       You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water. Where the object meets the water, it looks out of place. This bending of the light happens at the point where air meets water.        Why does refraction occur?     When light moves from the less dense air to a \u2018heavier\u2019 - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly.   Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air.

This is called a  reversible change .&nbsp;  A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt.  We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism.&nbsp;  Reversible changes can also occur when the  state  of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate.  &nbsp;    Irreversible changes    When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an  irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them.  For example, you can't \u2018uncook\u2019 an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't \u2018untoast\u2019 a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible.

Some solids, liquids, and gases in the world are  mixtures . They are made up of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. These mixtures are examples of  reversible  changes in that they can be separated back into their original substances.&nbsp;  For example, if we mix salt into water, we will make a mixture. However, this mixture can be separated back into salt and water. This can be done by evaporating the water, which leaves behind the salt.&nbsp;   Mixtures &amp; solubility   If a substance can dissolve in water, we can say it is  soluble . If a substance cannot dissolve in water, it is  insoluble .&nbsp;  Some insoluble substances will sink to the bottom and some will float to the top. Some will do both while others are suspended in the water.&nbsp;  For example, when you swim in the ocean you can't see chunks of salt in the water, even though you know that the sea is salty. This is because the salt has dissolved in the water - it is soluble. But if you were eating some corn and some corn kernels fell into the water, they wouldn't be dissolved. You would be able to see them float for hours. This is because those corn kernels are  insoluble .  How much a substance dissolves in water can be affected by factors such as:    The temperature of the water . Warm or hot water dissolves more of a substance and at a faster rate than cold water   How much the water is moving .

How do we get there?     Now that you have selected your planet or moon, let's look at how we are going to get there!&nbsp;    Travelling to new planets or moons takes a long time and involves moving at an incredible speed. This, of course, leads us to rockets.&nbsp;    To get a rocket into space, you must understand how the laws of physics and other forces affect rocket flight. Without this knowledge, you cannot design a rocket to reach the speeds and heights necessary to enter orbit.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    How do rockets work?      Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion     The rocket launching experiment we will do later (using a film canister as our rocket) is an example of Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion \u2013 \u201c Every action has an equal and opposite reaction \u201d. The gas rushing out of one end of the canister (the action) causes the rocket to move in the opposite direction (the reaction). Just like what happens when you let the air out of a balloon!       Newton's Third Law &amp; Balloons       This is exactly how all rockets work - whether you use baking soda and vinegar as your fuel or a chemical rocket propellant like they do at NASA.     How do the NASA rockets work?     These rockets use a pressurized fuel and an oxidizer. The oxidizer is something that allows the fuel to burn without using outside air. The fuel, in a gaseous state, is pressurized because this forces it out the end of the rocket just like our film canister rocket! However, there are a few more parts to an actual rocket.    NASA rockets use  liquid hydrogen  as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. The fuel and oxidizer are only in these liquid states when they are in the holding tanks and they can only stay in this liquid state at extremely low temperatures. The fuel and oxidizer are allowed to combine within the combustion chamber and, as they burn, they turn into a gas (gases take up about 1,000 times more space than a liquid).&nbsp;    This causes the intense pressure and is exactly like our film canister rocket. The carbon dioxide builds up and puts intense pressure on the canister so the lid pops off. In the case of our rocket, the fuel and oxidizer burn, are put under intense pressure, and are released through chutes at the bottom of the rocket. This propels the rocket upwards.       Rocket Science: A Short Explanation         Rocket fuel experiment     Getting the fuel ratios right is a vital part of a successful rocket launch. You are going to try and find the most powerful combination of fuel to launch your rocket.    In this experiment, we are going to use baking soda and vinegar to launch our rockets. Baking soda and vinegar react to form carbon dioxide - a gas. When this reaction occurs in a film canister, the gas builds up until it can no longer be contained and the base of the canister shoots off.     Aim     To investigate the most effective fuel combination to launch a rocket     Materials         35 mm film canister with internal snapping lid (clear Fuji ones work the best)    Timer      Water &amp; vinegar    Metre ruler or tape measure      Baking soda    Chalk      Waxed paper or bowl    Paper towel      Measuring spoons    Protective clothing and safety glasses         Method      Place 1 teaspoon of baking soda onto the waxed paper or bowl. Add 1\/8 tsp of water to the baking soda and mix it in well. If you are using waxed paper, carefully use the wax paper to fold the damp baking soda onto itself to help mix in the water    Turn the film canister lid upside-down and pack the inside of the depression with the damp baking soda. (Do not put baking soda where the canister snaps onto the lid.) Pack it tightly&nbsp;    Turn the lid right side-up again for a moment. Does the damp baking soda stay in place? If it stays, move to the next step. If the baking soda falls out, then add a little bit more water to the baking soda and mix it in, but try to add as little water as needed. The baking soda will not need to stay in the lid long    Add 5 tsp of vinegar (1 tsp at a time) to the canister at a time, filling it almost to the top. You need to add as much vinegar to the canister as possible without the vinegar and the baking soda coming into contact when you later snap the lid onto the canister    Go outside to an open area at least three metres from buildings. If possible, find a nearby wall and, using the chalk and metre ruler or tape measure, mark out 50 cm heights (to about two metres high) on the wall    Bend down near the ground on a flat, hard spot and quickly snap the lid onto the canister to seal it. Immediately turn the canister over, so the lid is on the ground, and quickly move away. The other members of the group should start timing and recording while this happens. Wait for the chemical reaction to occur    Stop timing and filming when your rockets comes back down to the ground. Record your results in your results table    Tip: If the rocket did not launch, the lid might not have been sealed tightly enough. (If this happens you may simply see many bubbles coming out of the canister). The rocket may not have launched right for another reason (such as not sealing the lid fast enough). If it did not launch right, try preparing and launching the canister rocket again. You may need a little practice to get used to launching the rocket    Carefully rinse out the lid and canister with water and then dry them    Prepare the damp baking soda and vinegar again but this time use 3 tsp of vinegar    Launch your newly prepared canister rocket as you did in Step 6. Record your results    Rinse the lid and canister with water, dry them, and prepare them as before but this time use 1 tsp of vinegar    Launch the canister rocket. How long does it take to launch compared to the other two launches? How high does the canister go compared to the previous two times?    If you are unsure of any of your results, you can try repeating them (using the same amount of baking soda and vinegar)     Before you start the experiment, predict which fuel combination will be the most effective\/powerful. Why?   5 tsp of vinegar  3 tsp of vinegar  1 tsp of vinegar    Which fuel combination worked the best? Why? Was your prediction correct? &nbsp;   Why do you think the NASA scientists need to be very precise with the amount of fuel they have on board the rocket before take-off? "}

This is called  rust .&nbsp;    R\u00adust is the common name for a very common compound,  iron oxide.  Iron oxide eats away at the iron and makes it weaker.    Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust.

Bees are especially important for plants that have white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers \u2013 this is because these are the colours that their eyes can most easily see, so these are the flowers they most regularly pollinate\"","task_title":"What's happening to bees?","task_content":"What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? "}
