Why the past matters    We don't have any formal obligations to preserve ancient sites, unless they are protected by law. So why do we bother protecting them?&nbsp;Do ancient sites have any value for us?&nbsp;   They connect us to the past   Preserving ancient sites and objects is important when they reflect our cultural, social, economic, political, archaeological, or architectural history. This history is important because it connects us to specific times, places, and events that were significant milestones in our collective past.  Visiting these sites provides us with a sense of place, and maintains continuity between our past and our present. It helps us understand how we arrived at where and who we are today.   Social &amp; cultural benefits   A community benefits when its citizens take pride in its history and share a common desire to preserve and share their unique past. The tangible presence that ancient sites provide enriches the cultural heritage of a place and its people. They help people connect with each other and with the place that they live. It makes them feel part of something that has existed for hundreds or thousands of years.   It expands human knowledge   By studying history, we learn more about who we are and where we've come from. This grows our knowledge about our species and civilisations, which we can use to make better decisions into the future. Knowing how ancient people and societies dealt with issues in the past helps us to recognise those same issues in the present or the future. And if we know how people tried to respond to these problems in the past and what worked (and didn't work), we can use our learnings to make better decisions today.&nbsp;   Economic benefits   Maintaining and saving ancient sites creates a major demand for tourism. Visiting ancient sites provides people from all over the world with an opportunity to enjoy something spectacular and learn about other cultures and their histories.  For this reason, preserving ancient sites can make a big difference to a country's economy. For example, close to 15 million people visit the Pyramids of Giza (in Egypt) every year! Many of these visitors would not visit Egypt if the Pyramids had not been protected and preserved.&nbsp;  Visitors who are there to see ancient sites spend money on accommodation, food and drink, and on other local wares. This creates employment for thousands of people. The act of preserving an ancient site and making it available to the public also creates many jobs for local communities (workers, cleaners, tour guides, security guards, etc).   Name a historical site you have been to, or would like to visit one day. What did you like about it, or why would you like to visit this site?   Provide three reasons for why you think it is great that this site has been preserved   Is there anything you would add to this list? Name one other reason why you think we should preserve ancient sites   What do you think is the most important reason to preserve ancient sites out of the factors you have looked at? Why? "}

Flowering plants are called  angiosperms  (which means \u2018hidden seeds\u2019 in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds.  In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task.  Most flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. A flower's male reproductive system is called the  stamen . A flower's female reproductive system is called the  carpel .&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Stamen   There are usually multiple stamens in each flower. The stamen includes:   The  anther , which is where pollen (male sex cells or plant sperm) is produced  The  filament , which is a small stalk that supports\/holds the anther    Carpel   There is often only one carpel in each flower. However, when there are multiple carpels fused together in the same flower, this is called a  pistil .  The carpel includes:   The  stigma , which is the site where pollen is deposited. When pollen is deposited on the stigma, this is called  pollination  and means the plant has been fertilised  The  style , which is the large stalk in the centre of the flower. It connects the stigma to the ovary  The  ovary , which produces the eggs (ovules) and the seeds once they form  The  ovules , which are the eggs produced by a plant once fertilisation has occurred      &nbsp;  Though the  petal  and the  sepal  are not part of a flower's male or female reproductive structure, they both play an important role.&nbsp;   The  petals  of a flower are what attracts pollinators to the flower.

You must include accurate drawings and labels of the following: petal, sepal, stamen, anther, filament, stigma, style, ovary, ovule   Explain the role of coloured petals, fragrance, and sepals in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants   Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat?   Why is it important that the ovules are found where they are?   Why is it important for the seeds to be found within the fruit?   Pollen is usually light, smooth, and easy to get from the anthers. There is often an abundance of pollen, and it can be quite difficult to remove from your fingers. Explain how these traits help ensure that pollen is used to pollinate flowers "}

There are lots of enormous objects in space but they aren't all considered planets.&nbsp;       What is a Planet?       A planet needs to have three key features:     It must orbit a star (in our solar system, this is the Sun).    It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. A rectangular asteroid is therefore not a planet    It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun. A cluster of objects close together are therefore unlikely to be planets       How big are our planets?     Our solar system features  eight planets.  Although there is some debate within the scientific community as to whether Pluto should be classified as a planet or a \u2018dwarf planet\u2019, it is now widely accepted that it is not a planet.    Some planets in our solar system are really big while others are quite small.&nbsp;       Size and Distance in Our Solar System       For us to get an idea about each planet\u2019s size, we are going to look at their scale compared with Earth.

You will be making a model of each of the eight planets in the solar system.&nbsp;    You will start with Earth. Imagine you shrink Earth to a small sphere. You will then shrink all the seven other planets by the same proportion so that they are all at the same scale.

You will need to blow up a balloon until it has a diameter of about 22 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Jupiter label on your model    Saturn has a diameter of about  19 cm . Blow up another balloon until it has a diameter of about 19 cm and tie it.

Light &amp; colour     As we saw in our properties of light experiment, visible white light is made up of a rainbow of colours. This visible white light is the only source of colour in our world.&nbsp;    Colour is a result of what parts of visible white light are absorbed or reflected by an object. For example, when white light shines on a red object, all of the colours that form the white light are absorbed except red, which is reflected. This is why the object we see appears red. Colour pigments - such as paints, dyes, or inks - show colour by absorbing certain parts of the light spectrum and reflecting the parts that remain.        Filters     What about things like coloured windows that can change the colour of objects when light shines through them? These are referred to as  filters.  A filter is a transparent material that absorbs some colours and allows others to pass through them.&nbsp;    A purple colour filter will let through only purple and absorb all other colours.&nbsp;When a blue light is allowed through a blue filter onto a blue object, the object will still reflect blue and therefore appear blue. But when blue light from a blue filter hits a red object, the blue will be absorbed by the red object and no light will be reflected. This will give the object an appearance of being black.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To investigate which colours absorb the most of visible white light     Materials         Torch    A darkened space      Red, green and blue construction paper    1 x white A4 paper      Transparent coloured cellophane - red, green, and blue    Masking tape or a rubber band         Method      Darken the room as much as possible    Turn on the torch and aim it at the white paper.

Predicting offspring traits    In the alien activity in the last task, you used a coin toss to determine the alleles which your alien offspring inherited. But, in the real world, we can predict the likelihood of offspring inheriting certain alleles with greater precision. Using Mendel\u2019s inheritance laws, we can predict the genotype and phenotype of basic genetic crosses.  Before we explore how to do this, we first need to understand how to use  Punnett squares . A Punnett square is a simple tool which helps us identify the possible variations - and the probabilities of each variation - which can occur through reproduction, based on Mendelian inheritance.      Punnett Squares and Mendelian Inheritance      Look at the example below. It shows the alleles from two \u2018parent\u2019 flowers. Both parents have one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele.      To interpret this:   Each square is a possible option for the alleles which the offspring flower will receive. To fill this in, you take the letter from the top row and pair it with the letter from the left column. Remember that a dominant gene is always capitalised and always is written before a recessive gene in the pairings (e.g. Bb)  We can see that, in the three of the four squares, a dominant gene will be inherited by the offspring flower. This means that there is a \u00be (or 75%) chance that the flower will exhibit the dominant gene (in this case, the colour purple) in their phenotype  In one of the four squares, the offspring flower receives two recessive genes. This means that there is a \u00bc (or 25%) chance that the flower will exhibit the recessive gene (the colour white) in their phenotype   Remember that we can determine both an offspring's possible genotype  and  their phenotype by using a Punnett square.   A homozygous cross   Homozygous individuals have two of the same alleles for a particular gene. This might be a dominant gene (e.g. XX) or a recessive gene (xx).  If two parents who both have two dominant genes (XX &amp; XX), the offspring will inherit XX as there is no recessive gene to inherit. The opposite is true for two parents who both have two recessive genes (xx &amp; xx): the offspring must inherit two recessive genes (xx).  But what if one parent is homozygous with two dominant genes (XX) and the other is homozygous with two recessive genes (xx)?

Spatial variation in liveability    Based on your perceptions of liveability, are cities or country towns more liveable? Where would you prefer to live?  Spatial variation refers to differences in patterns between areas or regions. For example, some suburbs in the same city report higher rates of crime than their neighbouring suburbs. And there is often a difference in education and income levels between people who live in more urban areas and those who live in rural areas.  These spatial variations inevitably lead to differences in liveability within countries and places.  &nbsp;    Why are cities generally more liveable?    Most people choose to live in urban areas due to employment opportunities and access to services. With their large population and greater wealth - due to greater economic activity - urban areas have better access to services such as schools, medical facilities, shopping centres, and recreation facilities.  For example,  Tokyo  (the capital of Japan) is home to over 37 million residents and has thousands of medical centres, convenience stores, and public amenities to cater for them.&nbsp;      Tokyo - City Guide      Due to their large populations but limited land size, urban areas tend to have high and medium  density  housing. This means that lots of people are living in close proximity, generally in high-rise apartments. This is an efficient use of space but it can increase  congestion  (how crowded a place is). High-density living also needs to be balanced by plenty of public spaces so that people don't feel \u2018walled in\u2019.      Singapore - Balancing Density &amp; Space      Many people prefer space to density. That's why a city's suburbs tend to grow quickly. Suburbs offer relative proximity to cities but tend to be more affordable and can offer more medium and low density housing. To support suburbs, a city needs excellent public transport and good roads. When this doesn't happen, liveability decreases.      Liveability in the Suburbs      However, this doesn't mean all cities are equally liveable. Whether one city is more liveable than another can depend on many factors - like how well-planned the city is, how wealthy it is, how good the government is, the space available for that city, and how old it is.  &nbsp;    Why are rural areas generally less liveable?    In developed countries, rural areas are far less populated than urban cities. Rural land is usually used for agriculture and, because rural towns generally don't have large economies supporting a diverse range of jobs, they find it harder to attract as many people as cities.  This combination of fewer people and less wealth means rural areas do not have the same access to services - like schools, healthcare, and entertainment venues - as cities.  For example, there are over 200 hospitals in greater Sydney but only 15 for the rest of New South Wales - even though Sydney only takes up 1.5% of NSW's land! This is because it is too expensive to build and run hospitals in rural areas where the populations are small, and it is hard to attract the specialist staff needed to work in them.  In some countries, rural areas are less liveable because of very unequal  wealth distribution .

They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building.

Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down.

Predicting offspring traits    In the alien activity in the last task, you used a coin toss to determine the alleles which your alien offspring inherited. But, in the real world, we can predict the likelihood of offspring inheriting certain alleles with greater precision. Using Mendel\u2019s inheritance laws, we can predict the genotype and phenotype of basic genetic crosses.  Before we explore how to do this, we first need to understand how to use  Punnett squares . A Punnett square is a simple tool which helps us identify the possible variations - and the probabilities of each variation - which can occur through reproduction, based on Mendelian inheritance.      Punnett Squares and Mendelian Inheritance      Look at the example below. It shows the alleles from two \u2018parent\u2019 flowers. Both parents have one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele.      To interpret this:   Each square is a possible option for the alleles which the offspring flower will receive. To fill this in, you take the letter from the top row and pair it with the letter from the left column. Remember that a dominant gene is always capitalised and always is written before a recessive gene in the pairings (e.g. Bb)  We can see that, in the three of the four squares, a dominant gene will be inherited by the offspring flower. This means that there is a \u00be (or 75%) chance that the flower will exhibit the dominant gene (in this case, the colour purple) in their phenotype  In one of the four squares, the offspring flower receives two recessive genes. This means that there is a \u00bc (or 25%) chance that the flower will exhibit the recessive gene (the colour white) in their phenotype   Remember that we can determine both an offspring's possible genotype  and  their phenotype by using a Punnett square.   A homozygous cross   Homozygous individuals have two of the same alleles for a particular gene. This might be a dominant gene (e.g. XX) or a recessive gene (xx).  If two parents who both have two dominant genes (XX &amp; XX), the offspring will inherit XX as there is no recessive gene to inherit. The opposite is true for two parents who both have two recessive genes (xx &amp; xx): the offspring must inherit two recessive genes (xx).

Temperature is a measure of heat in a certain place at a certain time. It's influenced by five main factors:    Latitude . The latitude of a place is its position on Earth relative to the equator. The closer a place is to the equator, the warmer it will be   Altitude .  The  altitude  of a place is its height above sea level. As altitude increases by 100m, the temperature decreases by around 1\u00b0C    Ocean temperatures &amp; currents . Shallower oceans, or oceans near the equator, are generally warmer. Deeper oceans and oceans closer to the Poles are cooler. Generally, places found next to a warm ocean will have higher temperatures and wetter climates. Places found next to cool oceans have colder and drier climates   Distance from oceans . Coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland areas. This is because oceans lose heat less quickly than land, so in winter an ocean will still retain some warmth from the summer sun   Topography (or relief) . The  aspect  of a slope (the direction it faces) affects its temperature. If it faces the sun during the day, it will be warmer than a slope facing away from the sun   The temperate of a place affects its air pressure. This in turn affects how much rainfall it gets and the direction of the prevailing wind in that area. These factors create the weather in a place.

The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? "}

As far as we know, there isn't another planet or moon out there which is perfectly suited for human life.
